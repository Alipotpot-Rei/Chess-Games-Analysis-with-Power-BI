# Chess-Games-Analysis-with-Power-BI

### Project Goals

* To gain insights into chess game patterns and player performance using data visualization and analysis techniques in Power BI.
* To identify factors that contribute to winning or losing a chess game.
* To explore relationships between player ratings, openings, game outcomes, and other relevant variables.
* To create an interactive Power BI dashboard that allows users to explore the data and draw their own conclusions.

###  Data Source

* Kaggle Chess Games Dataset: This dataset contains information about chess games, including player details, game results, moves, openings, and other relevant metadata. (Specify the exact dataset from Kaggle if possible, as there are multiple chess datasets)
* Example Kaggle Datasets:
    * Chess Game Dataset (Lichess)
    * Chess Games - Kaggle
 
    * Dataset Profile (The dataset is similar to those from IBM Telco, Kaggle, or CRM systems like Salesforce)
    - Industry: Telecommunications (Mobile/Wireless or ISP)
    - Scope: Customer retention analytics
    - Time Frame: Likely 1-2 years of customer records
    - Sample Size: 6,687 rows.

### Project Scope

* **Data Acquisition and Preparation:**
    * Download the chess games dataset from Kaggle.
    * Clean and transform the data using Power Query in Power BI.
    * Handle missing values, inconsistencies, and data type conversions.
    * Create calculated columns (e.g., game duration, rating difference).
* **Data Analysis and Visualization:**
    * Explore the dataset to understand its structure and content.
    * Create visualizations to analyze various aspects of the games, such as:
        * Win/loss/draw distribution
        * Player rating distribution and performance
        * Popularity and success rates of different openings
        * Relationship between game length and outcome
        * Impact of time control on game results
        * Player performance over time
    * Use Power BI's features to create interactive dashboards with filters, slicers, and drill-down capabilities.
* **Key Metrics and Analysis:**
    * Player win rates
    * Opening success rates (White vs. Black)
    * Average game length
    * Most common game termination methods (e.g., checkmate, resignation)
    * Elo rating changes
    * Correlations between player ratings and game outcomes
* **Potential Analysis Areas:**
    * Opening Analysis: Which openings are most common? Which have the highest win rates for white/black?
    * Player Performance: How do player ratings correlate with win rates? Are there differences in performance between different rating levels?
    * Game Characteristics: How does the length of a game affect the outcome? How often do games end in draws?
    * Temporal Analysis: Are there any trends in game outcomes or player ratings over time?
    * Impact of Game Settings: How does the time control affect the game outcome?

## Power BI Deliverables

* Interactive Power BI dashboard with multiple pages, including:
    * Overview page: Key statistics and summary of the dataset.
    * Player analysis page: Player ratings, win rates, and performance metrics.
    * Opening analysis page: Opening popularity, success rates, and trends.
    * Game Analysis Page: Game duration, termination types, and other game characteristics
    * Filters and slicers for interactive data exploration.
* Clear and concise visualizations (charts, graphs, tables).
* User-friendly design and navigation.
* Documentation of the project, including data sources, methodology, and key findings.

### Tools and Technologies

* Power BI Desktop
* Power Query (for data transformation)
* Kaggle (for data source)
